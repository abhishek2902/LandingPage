Hello LinkedIn community!

I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be embarking on a journey to create and share 10 HTML/CSS responsive projects over the next 10 days. These projects are designed for students and beginners who want to practice and improve their web development skills.

Continuing with my 10-day journey of creating and sharing HTML/CSS responsive projects for students and beginners, here is Day 4!

🚀 **Day 4 of 10: Landing Page - HTML/CSS Project** 🚀

Today's project is a responsive landing page. This project focuses on creating a visually appealing and functional landing page that could be used for a product, service, or company. The landing page includes sections for features, testimonials, and a call-to-action.

Stay tuned for more projects over the next 6 days. I hope these projects inspire and help you in your web development journey.
